## Practice Workshop 5
1. Create a python file **combine.py** to let people enter the filename in the data folder. (Please exclude the "-A.txt" in the file name). Then it will read <filename-A.txt> and <filename-B.txt> file, read each line from each file and combine them line by line, odd line be A.txt file and even line be B.txt file. Save the combined text and save to <filename-out.txt> file. Also print out the content to see what's the picture generated.
