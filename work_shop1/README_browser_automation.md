- Python 3.7 - 3.11. note do not use the 3.13 version
- `pip` (Python package manager)

#### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with your systemâ€™s Python packages.

##### Creating a Virtual Environment

1. **Create the virtual environment**:
   Run the following command in your terminal (replace `myenv` with any name you like):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
